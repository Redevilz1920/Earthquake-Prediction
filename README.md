# Earthquake Prediction

As a group we are trying to come up with an solution to this question:

### What is the probability of an earthquake occurring in a chosen location in China and its surroundings?

Earthquakes are the sudden and violent shaking of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic plates which causes are amounts of devastation. We believe that predicting earthquake probability for a given coordinate can provide valuable information for disaster management and emergency response, and can ultimately help to save lives and reduce the impact of earthquakes on communities. Our objective is to use an earthquake dataset to find out the probability of an earthquake happening given a pair of coordinates using clustering.
